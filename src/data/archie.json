      "text": "*The Maroon* is the University of Chicago’s most-read student publication. We’ve been keeping the University community informed of what’s happening on campus since 1892, making us the oldest student organization at UChicago.\n\n*The Maroon* has offered a transformative experience for generations of staff, teaching skills that have helped launch careers in journalism, business, law, engineering, and more. Our alums have won Pulitzer Prizes, uncovered scandals that have defined presidential administrations, founded successful and influential companies, and have even been appointed to the Supreme Court.\n\nOur journalism is read by millions of people every year. Our coverage has been featured in national publications like the *Washington Post*, *The Atlantic*, and the *Wall Street Journal*.\n\n*The Maroon* has been covering the complicated finances of University trustees, campus policing, graduate students’ efforts to form a recognized union, and serious discussions about mental health and campus climate. This year, there will be no shortage of interesting stories for our reporters to tackle.\n\nBeyond reporting, as an independent organization, *The Maroon* is a real enterprise: we earn revenues, have expenditures, and need a competent business team to balance the books and grow the paper. We own a website that needs the talents of gifted programmers: to create, maintain, and, yes, debug. Whether you’re interested in business and want to gain experience working with a real enterprise or a CS student looking for a space to showcase their latest creations, *The Maroon* offers many opportunities beyond journalism.\n\n"
